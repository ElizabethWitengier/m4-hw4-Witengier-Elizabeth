       <h2>Early Years</h2>
       <p>
         Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta was born on March 28, 1986, at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, New York
         City, to an upper-middle-class Catholic family. Her parents have Italian ancestry, and she also has more
         distant French-Canadian roots. Her parents are Cynthia Louise (née Bissett), a philanthropist and business
         executive, and Internet entrepreneur Joseph Germanotta, and she has a younger sister named Natalie.
       </p>
       <p>
         Brought up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Gaga said that her parents came from lower-class families and
         worked hard for everything. She attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart, a private all-girls Roman Catholic
         school from age eleven. Gaga has described her high-school self as "very dedicated, very studious, very
         disciplined," and "a bit insecure." She considered herself a misfit and mocked for "being either too
         provocative or too eccentric."

       <p>
         Gaga began playing the piano at age four when her mother insisted she become "a cultured young woman." She
         took piano lessons and practiced through her childhood. The classes taught her to create music by ear, which
         she preferred over reading sheet music.
       </p>
       <p>
         In 2003, at age 17, Gaga gained early admission to Collaborative Arts Project 21, a music school at New York
         University (NYU)'s Tisch School of the Arts. She studied music and improved her songwriting skills by writing
         essays on art, religion, social issues, and politics. In 2005, she withdrew from school during the second
         semester of her second year to focus on her music career. That year, she also played an unsuspecting diner
         customer for MTV's <i>Boiling Points,</i> a prank reality television show.

       <h3>The Fame Ball Tour</h3>
       <p>
         Gaga headlined the Fame Ball Tour worldwide, which ran from March to September 2009. While traveling the
         globe, she wrote eight songs for <i>The Fame Monster,</i> a reissue of <i>The Fame.</i> Those new songs were released as a
         standalone EP on November 18, 2009. Its first single, "Bad Romance," was released one month earlier and went
         number one in Canada and the UK and number two in the US, Australia, and New Zealand. "Telephone," with
         Beyoncé, followed as the second single from the EP and became Gaga's fourth UK number one. Both tracks reached
         the top five in the US. The video for "Bad Romance" became the most-watched on YouTube in April 2010, and that
         October, Gaga became the first person with more than one billion combined views.
       </p>
       <h3>Born This Way Tour</h3>
       <p>
         <i>Born This Way</i> was released on May 23, 2011, and debuted atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 1.1
         million copies. The album sold eight million copies worldwide and received three Grammy nominations, including
         Gaga's third consecutive nomination for Album of the Year. <i>Rolling Stone</i> listed it among "The 500 Greatest
         Albums of All Time" in 2020. Born This Way's next singles were "You and I" and "Marry the Night," which
         reached numbers six and 29 in the US, respectively. While filming the former's music video, Gaga met and
         started dating actor Taylor Kinney in July 2011, who played her love interest. She also embarked on the Born
         This Way Ball tour in April 2012, which was scheduled to conclude the following March, but ended one month
         earlier when Gaga canceled the remaining dates due to a labral tear of her right hip that required surgery.
         While refunds for the cancellations were estimated to be worth $25 million, the tour grossed $183.9 million
         globally.

       <h2>Music</h2>
       <p>
        Critics have analyzed and scrutinized Gaga's musical and performance style, as she has experimented with new ideas and images throughout her career. She says the continual reinvention is "liberating" herself, which she has been drawn to since childhood. Gaga is a contralto, with a range spanning from B♭2 to B5. She has changed her vocal style regularly, and considers <i>Born This Way</i> "much more vocally up to par with what I've always been capable of." In summing up her voice, <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> wrote: "There's an immense emotional intelligence behind the way she uses her voice. Almost never does she overwhelm a song with her vocal ability, recognizing instead that artistry is to be found in nuance rather than lung power."

       <h2>Illness</h2>
       <p>
         Lady Gaga postponed her European tour because of an exacerbation of her fibromyalgia. A statement released via
         Twitter on September 14, 2017, proclaimed that she was “suffering from severe physical pain that has impacted
         her ability to perform.” Shortly thereafter, Gaga tweeted that she was suffering from fibromyalgia, an illness
         that I have been studying for 40 years. Around the same time, Netflix released the documentary film Gaga: Five
         Foot Two and reviews of the film mentioned that Gaga opens up about her “overwhelming pain.
       </p>
       <p>
         Although Lady Gaga does not state that she has been given a fibromyalgia diagnosis in the film, she tweeted,
         as noted, in September 2017 (the same month the documentary was released) that she has fibromyalgia. As with
         many patients, the diagnosis can be elusive. Gaga complains that “I have chased this pain for the past 5
         years.” Indeed, the average patient spends about 5 years before a diagnosis is made.
